[CMAK](https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK) (prev. Kafka Manager)
is a tool for monitoring and managing [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) clusters.

CMAK operator is a Helm chart combining set of utilities,
that allows to install and configure CMAK in K8s cluster.

![Component diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eshepelyuk/cmak-operator/master/arch.puml)

CMAK operator comprises following components:

* [CMAK](https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK/),
  powered by [CMAK docker](https://github.com/eshepelyuk/cmak-docker).
* [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/),
  powered by [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/zookeeper/).
* Custom [cmak2zk tool](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eshepelyuk/cmak2zk),
  used to configure Kafka clusters in CMAK from YAML files.

## Installation

It's recommended to install CMAK operator into a dedicated namespace.

1. Add Helm repository

    ```sh
    helm repo add cmak https://eshepelyuk.github.io/cmak-operator
    helm repo update
    ```

1. Install the latest version

    ```sh
    helm install --create-namespace -n cmak-ns mycmak cmak/cmak-operator
    ```

1. Search for all available versions

    ```sh
    helm search repo cmak-operator --versions

    NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
    cmak/cmak-operator      0.2.1           3.0.0.5         CMAK operator for K8S.
    cmak/cmak-operator      0.2.0           3.0.0.5         CMAK operator for K8S.
    ```

1. Install specific version

    ```sh
    helm install --create-namespace -n cmak-ns --version 0.2.1 mycmak cmak/cmak-operator
    ```

### Verify installation

By default, CMAK operator doesn't create neither `Ingress`
nor any other K8s resources to expose UI via HTTP.

The simpliest test is to port forward CMAK UI HTTP port and access it from browser.

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n cmak-ns service/cmak 9000:9000
```

Then, open http://localhost:9000 in a browser.

## Configuration

Configuration should be passed to helm via command line during installation or upgrade.

```sh
helm install --create-namespace -n cmak-ns -f cmak-values.yaml mycmak cmak/cmak-operator
```

### CMAK application settings

CMAK uses configuration file
[/cmak/conf/application.conf](https://github.com/yahoo/CMAK/blob/master/conf/application.conf).
Every parameter could be overriden via JVM system property, i.e. `-DmyProp=myVal`.
Properties are passed to CMAK container via `values.yaml`.

For example, to enable basic auth, add following to `values.yaml`.

```yaml
ui:
  extraArgs:
    - "-DbasicAuthentication.enabled=true"
    - "-DbasicAuthentication.username=admin"
    - "-DbasicAuthentication.password=password"
```

### Kafka clusters

It's extremely easy to configure multiple clusters in CMAK,
starting from cluster setup, connection settings and ending with authorization,
using [Helm values files](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/).

Check [CMAK operator values](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cmak-operator/cmak-operator?modal=values-schema)
for all available options and their description.

Minimal values.yaml configuration for adding a several Kafka clusters to CMAK.

```yaml
cmak:
  clusters:
    - name: "cluster-stage"
      curatorConfig:
        zkConnect: "kafka01.stage:2181,kafka02.stage:2181"
    - name: "cluster-prod"
      curatorConfig:
        zkConnect: "kafka01.prod:2181,kafka02.prod:2181,kafka03.prod:2181"
```

Connection settings could be configured for all clusters at once or per selected cluster.

```yaml
cmak:
  clustersCommon:
    curatorConfig:
      zkMaxRetry: 100 # <1>
  clusters:
    - name: "cluster-stage"
      kafkaVersion: "2.4.0" # <2>
      curatorConfig:
        zkConnect: "kafka01.stage:2181,kafka02.stage:2181"
    - name: "cluster-prod"
      kafkaVersion: "2.1.0" # <3>
      enabled: false
      curatorConfig:
        zkConnect: "kafka01.prod:2181,kafka02.prod:2181,kafka03.prod:2181"
```

1. this setting is applied to both clusters.
1. applied only to `cluster-stage`.
1. applied only to `cluster-prod`.

## Standalone cmak2zk tool

`cmak2zk` was developed as a part of CMAK operator and actively used by the operator itself.
But the same time this tool could be used on its own outside of Helm charts and Kubernetes.

Its purpose is to take Kafka cluster configuration for CMAK in YAML format
and populate CMAK compatible config in Zookeeper.
This allows to avoid manual configuration of CMAK and provides better possibilities
to use CMAK in declarative configuration or GitOps based flows.

`cmak2zk` is distributed as [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eshepelyuk/cmak2zk).

To check out available options, run the image without parameters.

```sh
docker run eshepelyuk/cmak2zk:1.4.1
```

Example `docker-compose` and Kafka cluster configuration are located at
[cmak2zk/examples](https://github.com/eshepelyuk/cmak-operator/tree/master/cmak2zk/examples) directory.
One could run them using commands below.

```sh
curl -sLo clusters.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eshepelyuk/cmak-operator/master/cmak2zk/examples/clusters.yaml

curl -sLo docker-compose-cmak2zk.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eshepelyuk/cmak-operator/master/cmak2zk/examples/docker-compose-cmak2zk.yaml

docker-compose -f docker-compose-cmak2zk.yaml up
```

Wait for some time until components are stabilizing, it may take up to 5 mins.
Then, open your browser at http://localhost:9000.
There should be two pre-configured clusters, pointing to the same Kafka instance, running in Docker.

## Alternatives

[AKHQ](https://akhq.io/) project seems to be the most active open source tool
for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters.
It could be missing some functionality from CMAK,
but their developers are open for feature requests and contributions.
